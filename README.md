**Machine Learning Project for Data Structures and Algorithms**

This project implements a machine learning solution for cancer diagnosis using the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm and k-d trees. 
It analyzes the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, focusing on optimizing both accuracy and efficiency. 
The project includes data preprocessing, training/testing splits, and evaluation for different values of k and training sizes.
