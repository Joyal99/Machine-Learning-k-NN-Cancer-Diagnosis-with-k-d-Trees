 # **Machine Learning Project for Data Structures and Algorithms**

This project implements a machine learning solution for cancer diagnosis using the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm and k-d trees. 
It analyzes the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data?resource=download), focusing on optimizing both accuracy and efficiency. 
The project includes data preprocessing, training/testing splits, and evaluation for different values of k and training sizes. 

This project aims to use machine learning by taking a set of 569 instances of data to run diagnositscs for accuracy and study the computational efficiency and scalability of our solution. The machine learning model will use the k-nearest neighbour algroithm (k-NN), and will use a tree data structure to optimize both the accuracy and efficiency of the program. The dataset is found in the "data.csv"
